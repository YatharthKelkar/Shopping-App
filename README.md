🛠️ Technologies Used
The app is built with the following technologies:

LocalStorage: For saving cart data locally so users can refresh the page without losing their cart contents.
npm: For managing all the necessary libraries and dependencies.
🛒 How to Use the App
Once everything is up and running, here’s how you can interact with the app:

1. Home Page
The home page displays products in a simple grid layout. Users can scroll through and view different products. Add a product to your cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button. 🛍️

2. Cart Page
Click the cart icon in the top-right corner to view all the items added to your cart. Users can see the quantity, price, and total of all items in their cart. You can even remove items! 🗑️

3. Shopping Cart Persistence
Thanks to LocalStorage, your cart will stay intact even if you refresh the page. This ensures users have a smooth shopping experience. 😄
